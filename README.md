# ü§ñ AI Interview Coach: Master Your Next Interview with AI

**Mission UpSkill India Hackathon Submission**


## üí° Overview

**AI Interview Coach** is an innovative, web-based platform designed to revolutionize job interview preparation. Leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) via OpenRouter, our application simulates realistic technical and behavioral interviews, provides instant, personalized feedback, and generates comprehensive improvement reports. Built during the Mission UpSkill India Hackathon, it aims to make high-quality interview coaching accessible, efficient, and effective for job seekers across India.

## üåü Problem Statement

Job seekers often face significant challenges in interview preparation:
* **Lack of Personalized Feedback:** Generic advice doesn't address individual weaknesses.
* **Insufficient Practice:** Difficulty finding structured, realistic mock interview opportunities.
* **Ineffective Methods:** Traditional static question banks lack adaptive, real-time interaction.
* **High Stress:** The pressure of interviews is exacerbated by inadequate preparation, hindering performance.

These limitations contribute to a skills-interview gap, preventing talented individuals from securing their desired roles.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

The AI Interview Coach directly addresses these pain points by offering:
* **Dynamic Interview Simulation:** Real-time Q&A tailored to specific roles and domains.
* **Intelligent Evaluation:** AI-powered analysis of responses for clarity, correctness, and completeness.
* **Actionable Feedback:** Instant scores, constructive comments, and concrete suggestions for improvement after each answer.
* **Comprehensive Reports:** A final summary detailing strengths, weaknesses, and recommended resources.
* **Accessibility:** A user-friendly, web-based platform available 24/7, making professional coaching affordable and scalable.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Role & Domain Selection:** Customize interviews for specific job roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst) and specializations (e.g., Frontend, Machine Learning, System Design).
* **Interview Modes:** Choose between **Technical** (algorithms, coding, system design) and **Behavioral** (STAR-method, teamwork, leadership) interviews.
* **Dynamic Q&A:** AI generates unique, relevant questions on the fly, ensuring varied practice.
* **Real-time AI Evaluation:** Instant feedback on each answer, including a score (1-10), detailed comments, and improvement suggestions.
* **Flexible Practice:** "Retry" or "Skip" functionality for each question.
* **Modern UI:** Clean, intuitive, and professional interface built with Streamlit, supporting Dark/Light modes.
* **Final Summary Report:** A comprehensive wrap-up of the entire session, highlighting strengths, areas to improve, and suggested resources.
* **Session Export:** Option to export the session summary as a PDF (future scope, but planned for immediate implementation post-hackathon).

## üí° Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

1.  **Frontend (Streamlit UI):**
    * Developed using Streamlit for rapid prototyping and interactive web interfaces.
    * Handles user input, displays questions, and presents feedback/reports.
    * Manages session state for a smooth user experience.

2.  **Backend Logic (Python):**
    * Pure Python script orchestrates the application flow.
    * Manages conversation history and interview progression.
    * Constructs and sends prompts to the LLM API.
    * Parses and processes responses from the LLM.

3.  **AI Engine (OpenRouter API):**
    * Acts as an abstraction layer to connect to various powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3, Mistral).
    * Generates dynamic interview questions based on user settings and previous conversation.
    * Evaluates user answers against predefined criteria (clarity, correctness, completeness, STAR method adherence).
    * Composes the final summary report.

4.  **Evaluator Module:**
    * Embedded within the LLM prompting, it defines the rubric for assessing answers, ensuring consistent and fair scoring.

5.  **Data Management:**
    * Leverages Streamlit's `st.session_state` for in-memory session tracking.
    * Utilizes JSON/Pandas structures for storing and summarizing conversation history and feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Streamlit:** For the interactive web user interface.
* **OpenRouter API:** For flexible and powerful LLM integration (access to GPT-4o, Claude 3, etc.).
* **`python-dotenv`:** For secure management of API keys.
* **`openai` library:** The Python client for interacting with the OpenAI/OpenRouter API.
* **`json`:** For structured data handling (LLM responses).
* **`pandas` (Optional/Planned):** For more robust session tracking and data analysis (future scope for persistent history).

## üèÉ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Interview Coach locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
cd ai-interview-coach
````

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Make sure to generate a `requirements.txt` file from your environment: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 4\. Configure API Key

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (where `app.py` is located) and add your OpenRouter API key:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE"
```

*(Note: If you used `openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))` in your code, ensure the `.env` variable matches this, e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY="..."`)*

### 5\. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8501/`.
